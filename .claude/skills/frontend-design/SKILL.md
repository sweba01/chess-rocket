# Frontend Design Skill Overview

The **frontend-design** skill is a Claude Code plugin designed to create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Key Purpose

Create visually striking, memorable, and cohesive web components, pages, and applications with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking Process

Before coding, understand and commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
2. **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic (brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art deco, soft/pastel, industrial, etc.)
3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
4. **Differentiation**: What makes it UNFORGETTABLE?

**Critical principle**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on these core areas:

### Typography
- Choose unique, characterful fonts—avoid generic choices (Arial, Inter)
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic using CSS variables
- Use dominant colors with sharp accents over timid, evenly-distributed palettes

### Motion
- Use animations for high-impact moments (staggered reveals, scroll-triggering)
- Prefer CSS-only solutions for HTML; Motion library for React
- Focus on well-orchestrated page loads rather than scattered micro-interactions

### Spatial Composition
- Use unexpected layouts: asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking
- Balance generous negative space or controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth (gradient meshes, noise textures, patterns, layered transparencies, shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays)

## What to Avoid

❌ Generic AI-generated aesthetics
- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable, cookie-cutter layouts

## Key Implementation Principle

**Match complexity to vision**: Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations; minimalist designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing and typography. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.
